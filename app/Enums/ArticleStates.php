/**
 * ArticleStates defines the possible lifecycle states of an article.
 *
 * This enumeration assigns specific integer values to each state an article can be in, such as "New" for a suggestion,
 * "Draft" for an in-progress article, "Approval" for articles awaiting review, "Published" for released content,
 * "Archived" for outdated entries, and "ExternalData" for articles based on external information.
 *
 * By implementing HasLabel, HasIcon, and HasColor interfaces, this enum provides Filament-compatible methods that return a
 * human-readable Dutch label, an associated icon, and a display color for each state. The getLabel() method uses a match
 * expression to map each state to its Dutch label. The getColor() method returns a uniform color ("gray") for all states, and
 * the getIcon() method returns the same document text icon for every state.
 *
 * The Comparable trait is included to enable direct comparisons between state instances, which is essential for enforcing
 * business rules and ordering the articles based on their state.
 *
 * This design ensures that article state management is consistent, type-safe, and seamlessly integrated with the Filament UI,
 * facilitating a clear and maintainable approach to tracking an articleâ€™s progress through its lifecycle.
