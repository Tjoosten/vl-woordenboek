 * ArticleState provides a base implementation of the ArticleStateContract for managing article state transitions.
 *
 * This class acts as a default state handler for an article and implements all methods defined in the ArticleStateContract.
 * However, each transition method in this default implementation throws a LogicException, indicating that the transition is not allowed for the current state.
 *
 * This design encourages developers to extend or override these methods in concrete state classes to define valid transitions and behaviors for a specific article state.
 * By default, if a transition is not supported by the current state, a clear exception message is provided.
 *
 * @property Article $article The article whose state is being managed.
