 * Welcome to the Region model - our way of mapping the rich tapestry of Flemish dialects
 * across different geographical areas.
 *
 * This model helps us understand where specific words and expressions come from.
 * Think of it as a digital map that connects linguistic features to their geographical origins.
 * Whether a word is typical for West-Vlaanderen or unique to the Kempen region,
 * this is where we keep track of those geographical connections.
 *
 * We keep things simple here each region has a name, and it can be connected to various linguistic features through a flexible polymorphic relationship.
 * This means we can link regions not just to words, but to any linguistic feature we might want to track in the future.
 *
 * @property int             $id            The unique identifier for the geographical region in the tabase.
 * @property string          $name          The nbame for the geographical region
 * @property \Carbon\Carbon  $created_at    Timestamp that indicates when the region has been created
 * @property \Carbon\Carbon  $updated_at    Timestamp that indicates when the region has been updated for the last time.
